## Overview

This is a classic Snake Game implementation using the Pygame library in Python. The game features a snake that the player controls to eat food and grow longer. The objective is to survive as long as possible without colliding with the snake's own body or the game boundaries.

## Features

- **Simple Controls:** Use arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.
- **Scoring:** Score points by eating food. The snake grows longer with each food item consumed.
- **Collision Detection:** The game ends if the snake collides with its own body or the game boundaries.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library: Install using `pip install pygame`
